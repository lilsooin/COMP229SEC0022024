                <br />

                I have experience in successfully developing and launching products
                for various services such as shopping mall, dashcam, kiosks, and lawn financial service.
                <br />
                I am very interested in improving the development culture and processes within companies.
                <br />
                In fact, I have reduced development time by creating and applying modular projects.
                <br />
                I have a keen interest in programming and enjoy learning about technology in my spare time, as well as discussing programming-related topics.
                <br />
